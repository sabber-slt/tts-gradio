<a href="https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v1">XTTS</a> is a Voice generation model that lets you clone voices into different languages by using just a quick 3-second audio clip. 
<br/>
Built on Tortoise, XTTS has important model changes that make cross-language voice cloning and multi-lingual speech generation super easy. 
<br/>
This is the same model that powers Coqui Studio, and Coqui API, however we apply a few tricks to make it faster and support streaming inference.
<br/>
<br/>
<p>For faster inference without waiting in the queue, you should duplicate this space and upgrade to GPU via the settings.
